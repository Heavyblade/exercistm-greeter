# Greeter

Welcome to the Greeter exercise on Exercism.

## Instructions

The Greeter exercise is a simple introduction to classes and methods in Ruby. You will create a `Greeter` class that takes a name as an argument and has a method `greet` that returns a greeting message.

### Tasks

1. Create a `Greeter` class with an initializer that takes a name.
2. Implement the `greet` method to return "Hello, <name>!".

### Example

```ruby
greeter = Greeter.new('World')
puts greeter.greet
# Output: Hello, World!
